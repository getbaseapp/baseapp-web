      ##Why is there no Support for BaseApp?

      BaseApp is no longer under active development (excluding critical bug
      fixes) and available for free on the Mac App Store, as a direct download,
      or on Github (source). Customers who have purchased BaseApp prior to May
      10th, 2011 are eligible for <a href="mailto:support@getbaseapp.com">support</a>. 

      ##Why is the Basecamp activity not limited to items I'm subscribed to?

      The Basecamp API provided by 37 Signals currently doesn't return a
      **subscribed only** feed.

      ##How can I prevent Basecamp projects from showing up in BaseApp?

      You can remove Basecamp projects from the BaseApp drop-down by disabling them
      individually in **Preferences > Accounts**.
